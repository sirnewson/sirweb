**Data Management:**

- **Import Data**: Restore content from a previous export
- **Clear All Data**: Delete everything (use with caution!)

## üíæ Data Storage

All content is stored in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ‚úÖ No server or database required
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ Fast and instant
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is browser-specific (export regularly for backups)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clearing browser data will delete your content

**Best Practice:** Export your data regularly as a backup!

## üñºÔ∏è Image Hosting

Since this is a static site, you'll need to host images externally. Recommended services:

1. **Wix Media** (you're already using this!)
   - Example: `https://static.wixstatic.com/media/...`

2. **Imgur** (Free, easy to use)
   - Upload at https://imgur.com
   - Right-click ‚Üí Copy image address

3. **Cloudinary** (Professional, free tier)
   - Sign up at https://cloudinary.com
   - Better for production sites

4. **GitHub** (If your site is on GitHub)
   - Create an `/images` folder in your repo
   - Reference as: `./images/poster.jpg`

## üìù Blog Post HTML Formatting

When writing blog content, you can use HTML tags:

```html
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>

<p>Regular paragraph text.</p>

<p><strong>Bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bullet point 1</li>
  <li>Bullet point 2</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>This is a quote or callout</blockquote>

<a href="https://example.com">Link text</a>
```

## üîÑ Workflow Example

### Adding a New Blog Post

1. Go to **Thoughts / Blog Posts** section
2. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "The Future of AI in Design"
   - Category: AI
   - Excerpt: "Exploring how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing..."
   - Content: Write your full article with HTML formatting
   - Tags: "ai, design, future"
3. Click **Generate Blog Post**
4. Browser downloads: `the-future-of-ai-in-design.html`
5. Upload this file to your website's root folder (same location as index.html)
6. The post is now live at: `yoursite.com/the-future-of-ai-in-design.html`

### Adding a New Client

1. Go to **Clients Management** section
2. Fill in client details
3. Click **Add Client**
4. Client is saved and will appear in your clients list
5. To display on your website, add the integration code (see Integration section below)

## üîå Integrating with Your Website

### For Clients Page

Add this to your HTML where you want clients to display:

```html
<!-- Add before </body> tag -->
<script src="content-api.js"></script>

<!-- Add where you want clients to appear -->
<div id="clientsGrid" class="clients-grid"></div>
```

### For Poster Gallery

```html
<div id="postersGallery" class="posters-gallery"></div>
<script src="content-api.js"></script>
```

### For Thoughts/Blog Page

```html
<div id="thoughtsGrid" class="thoughts-grid"></div>
<script src="content-api.js"></script>
```

### For Projects on Index Page

```html
<div id="dynamicProjects" class="projects-grid"></div>
<script src="content-api.js"></script>
```

The `content-api.js` file automatically loads and displays content from your admin system!

## üé® Customizing Blog Post Styling

The generated blog post HTML includes inline styles. To customize:

1. Go to **Thoughts** section in admin
2. Find the post you want to update
3. Click the **Regenerate** button (circular arrow icon)
4. Before clicking, you can edit the `admin-script.js` file's `generateBlogPostHTML()` function to change the template

## üîí Security Notes

- The admin dashboard has no built-in authentication
- Anyone with access to `admin.html` can edit content
- For a public website, consider:
  - Keeping admin.html in a separate, private location
  - Not uploading admin.html to your live site
  - Using `.htaccess` or server config to password-protect it

## üì± Mobile Access

The admin dashboard is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No content showing on my website"
- Make sure you've added `<script src="content-api.js"></script>` to your pages
- Check that the container IDs match (e.g., `id="clientsGrid"`)
- Open browser console (F12) to check for JavaScript errors

### "Lost my data"
- If you cleared browser cache, data is gone unless you exported it
- Always export before clearing browser data
- Always export before switching browsers

### "Blog post file downloaded but not working"
- Make sure you uploaded the `.html` file to your website's root directory
- Check that the filename doesn't have spaces or special characters
- Verify the file uploaded correctly (try accessing it directly in browser)

### "Images not showing"
- Verify image URLs are correct and publicly accessible
- Test image URL by pasting it directly in browser
- Check if image hosting service is working

## üìä Browser Compatibility

Works with modern browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Internet Explorer (Not supported)

## üéØ Tips & Best Practices

1. **Export Regularly**: Download your data backup every week
2. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Makes blog post files easier to manage
3. **Optimize Images**: Compress images before uploading to hosting services
4. **Tag Consistently**: Use consistent tag naming for better organization
5. **Preview Before Publishing**: Test blog post HTML files locally first
6. **Keep Backups**: Store exported JSON files in multiple locations
7. **Update Dates**: Set publish dates for blog posts to organize chronologically

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Bulk Import

1. Create a JSON file with multiple items:
```json
{
  "clients": [
    {"name": "Client 1", "type": "business", ...},
    {"name": "Client 2", "type": "creator", ...}
  ],
  "posters": [...],
  "thoughts": [...]
}
```

2. Use **Import Data** in Settings to upload

### Custom Styling

Edit the CSS in:
- `admin.html` for admin dashboard appearance
- `generateBlogPostHTML()` in `admin-script.js` for blog post styling

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
- Check this guide first
- Review the browser console (F12) for errors
